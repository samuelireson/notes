## Topologies
<Aside type='definition' title='Definition' name='Topology'>
	For a set $ X $, a <em> topology on $ X $ </em> is a collection $ \tau $ of subsets of $ X $ which satisfies,
	
		- $ \varnothing, X \in \tau $.
		- $ U_{1},...,U_{n}\in \tau \implies U_{1}\cap \cdots \cap U_{n} \in \tau $.
		- $ ( U_{\alpha} )_{\alpha \in A} \in \tau \implies \bigcup_{\alpha \in A}^{}{U_{\alpha}} \in \tau $.
	
	The pair $ ( X, \tau ) $ is called a <em> topological space </em>.
</Aside>

<Aside type='definition' title='Definition' name='Neighbourhood'>
	Given a topological space $ X $, a <em> neighbourhood </em> of a point $ p \in X $ is any open set $ U_{p} \in \tau $ containing $ p $.

	A <em> neighbourhood of the subset </em> $ K \subseteq X $ is an open set containing $ K $.
</Aside>

<Aside type='result' title='Proposition' name='Metric topology'>
	Let $ ( M, d ) $ be a metric space and let $ \tau $ be the collection of sets which are open in the sense of metric spaces. Then, $ ( M, \tau ) $ is a topological space.
	<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
		Proof of the statement amounts to showing that each of the defining properties of a topological space are true in the metric space.

		
			- $ \varnothing $ is vacuously open in $ M $, and $ M $ is clearly also open. Hence $ \varnothing, M \in \tau $.
			- Take $ U_{1}, ..., U_{n} \in \tau $, and consider a point $ p \in U_{1} \cap $. Since each of the sets $ U_{i} $ are open, there exist values $ r_{i} $ such that $ B ( p; r_{i} ) \subseteq U_{i} $ for all $ 1 \leq i \leq n $. Taking $ r = \min_{1 \leq i \leq n}\{ r_{i} \} $, we have that $ B ( p; r )\subseteq U_{1}\cap \cdots \cap U_{n} $, and hence this intersection is open.
			- For every point in the union, there is at least one open set $ U_{\alpha} $ containing the point, and an open ball around the point. Hence the union is open.
		
	</details>
</Aside>

<Aside type='comment' title='Notation' name=''>
	We have the following standard notations for common sets.
	
		- The open unit $ n $-ball:
$$
\begin{align*}
			      \mathbb{B}^{n} = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}: | x | < 1 \}
\end{align*}
$$
		- The closed unit $ n $-ball:
$$
\begin{align*}
			      \overline{\mathbb{B}}^{n} = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}: | x | \leq 1 \}
\end{align*}
$$
		- The unit $ n $-sphere:
$$
\begin{align*}
			      \mathbb{S}^{n} = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}: | x | = 1 \}
\end{align*}
$$
	
</Aside>

<Aside type='definition' title='Definition' name='Metrizable'>
	A topological space $ ( X, \tau ) $ is said to be <em> metrizable </em> if its topology is the same as that generated by some metric on $ X $.
</Aside>

### Closed subsets
<Aside type='definition' title='Definition' name='Closed sets'>
	A subset $ F $ of a topological space $ X $ is said to be <em> closed </em> if its complement $ X \setminus F $ is open.
</Aside>

For the proceeding four definitions, let $ A $ be any subset of a topological space $ X $.

<Aside type='definition' title='Definition' name='Closure'>
	The <em> closure </em> of $ A $  in $ X $ is defined to be,
$$
\begin{align*}
		\overline{A} = \bigcap{\{ B \subseteq X: B \supseteq A \text{ and } B \text{ is closed in } X \}}
\end{align*}
$$
</Aside>

<Aside type='definition' title='Definition' name='Interior'>
	The <em> interior </em> of $ A $ is defined to be,
$$
\begin{align*}
		\interior{A} = \bigcup{\{ C \subseteq X: C \subseteq A \text{ and } C \text{ is open in } X \}}
\end{align*}
$$
</Aside>

<Aside type='definition' title='Definition' name='Exterior'>
	The <em> exterior </em> of $ A $ is defined to be,
$$
\begin{align*}
		\exterior{A} = X \setminus \overline{A}
\end{align*}
$$
</Aside>

<Aside type='definition' title='Definition' name='Boundary'>
	The <em> boundary </em> of $ A $ is defined to be,
$$
\begin{align*}
		\boundary{A} = X \setminus ( \interior{A} \cup \exterior{A} )
\end{align*}
$$
</Aside>

<Aside type='result' title='Proposition' name=''>
	Let $ X $ be a topological space and let $ A \subseteq X $ be any subset.
	
		- A point is in $ \interior{A} $ if and only if it has a neighbourhood contained in $ A $.
		- A point is in $ \exterior{A} $ if and only is it has a neighbourhood contained in $ X \setminus A $.
		- A point is in $ \boundary{A} $ if and only if every neighbourhood of it contains both a point of $ A $ and a point of $ X \setminus A $.
		- A point is in $ \overline{A} $ if and only if every neighourhood of it contains a point of $ A $.
		- $ \overline{A} = A \cup \boundary{A} = \interior{A} \cup \boundary{A} $.
		- $ \interior{A} $ and $ \exterior{A} $ are open in $ X $, while $ \overline{A} $ and $ \boundary{A} $ are closed in $ X $.
		- The following are equivalent:
		      
			      - $ A $ is open in $ X $.
			      - $ A = \interior{A} $.
			      - $ A $ contains none of its boundary points.
			      - Every point of $ A $ has a neighbourhood contained in $ A $.
		      
		- The following are equivalent:
		      
			      - $ A $ is closed in $ X $.
			      - $ A = \overline{A} $.
			      - $ A $ contains all of its boundary points.
			      - Every point of $ X \setminus A $ has a neighbourhood contained in $ X \setminus A $.
		      
	
	<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
		We will work through each statement in turn.
		
			- Consider the following logical equivalence
$$
\begin{gather*}
				      x \in \interior{A}                                       \\
				      \iff                                                     \\
				      x \in \bigcup_{}^{}{\{ B \subseteq A: B \in \tau_{X} \}} \\
				      \iff                                                     \\
				      \exists B \subseteq A \text{ s.t. } ( x \in B \land B \in \tau_{X}).
\end{gather*}
$$
			      This is exactly the statement that there exists an open neighbourhood of $ x \in \interior{A} $ contained in $ \interior{A} $.
			- Assume first that $ x \in \exterior{A} $. Then, by definition, we have that $ x \in X \setminus \overline{A} $. Since $ \overline{A} $ is an intersection of closed sets, it is closed, and hence $ X \setminus \overline{A} $ is open. Furthermore, $ A \subseteq \overline{A} $, and equivalently, $ X \setminus \overline{A}\subseteq X \setminus A $. Therefore, $ X \setminus \overline{A} $ is a neighbourhood of $ x $ satisfying the desired property.

			      For the reverse implication, assume that $ x $ has an open neighbourhood $ U \subseteq X \setminus A $. Since $ U $ is open, $ X \setminus U $ is closed, and furthermore, $ X \setminus U \supseteq A $. From the definition of $ \overline{A} $, it must be the case that $ x \not\in \overline{A} $, hence $ x \in \exterior{A} $.

			- Given the previous two results, and the definition of $ \boundary{A} $, the statement is clear.

			- Given the second result, and the definition of $ \exterior{A} $, the statement is clear.

			- We first aim to show that $ A \cup \boundary{A} \subseteq \overline{A} $. Considering each of the LHS components in turn, we will consider neighbourhoods of points. Firstly, for $ x \in A $, any neighbourhood of $ x $ will contain $ x $ itself, and hence $ x \in \overline{A} $. Secondly, for $ x \in \boundary{A} $, we know by the third result that every neighbourhood contains a point of $ A $ (and $ X \setminus A $), therefore $ x \in \overline{A} $ also.

			      By the definition of $ \interior{A} $ we also have that $ \interior{A} \subseteq A $ -- the interior is a union of open sets contained by $ A $. Therefore, so far we have,
$$
\begin{align*}
				      \interior{A} \cup \boundary{A} \subseteq A \cup \boundary{A} \subseteq \overline{A}
\end{align*}
$$

			      We can also show by elementary set operations that,
$$
\begin{align*}
				      \interior{A} \cup \boundary{A} & = \interior{A} \cup ( X \setminus ( \interior{A} \cup \exterior{A} ) ) \\
				                                     & = X \setminus \exterior{A}                                             \\
				                                     & = \overline{A}
\end{align*}
$$

			      And hence the chain of inclusions is a chain of equalities, as needed.

			- Clearly $ \interior{A} $ is open, as a union of open sets. The same follows for the closedness of $ \overline{A} $ as an intersection of closed sets. As $ \exterior{A} $ is the $ X $-complement of $ \overline{A} $, it is open. As $ \boundary{A} $ is the $ X $-complement of a union of open sets, it is closed.

			- We first assume that $ A $ is open. Then clearly, every point $ x \in A $ has an open neighbourhood contained in $ A $, since $ A \subseteq A $. From this we know that $ \boundary{A} = \varnothing $ from the third result. From this we know that, $ A = \interior{A} $ since,
$$
\begin{gather*}
				      (A \cup \boundary{A} = \interior{A} \cup \boundary{A}) \land ( A \cap \boundary{A} = \varnothing )\\
				      \iff \\
				      A = \interior{A}
\end{gather*}
$$
			      also relying on the disjointness of $ \interior{A} $ and $ \boundary{A} $.

			      If $ A = \interior{A} $, then $ A $ is open, since $ \interior{A} $ is open. From this we have a full circle of equivalences.

			- These equivalences are easily validated, in a similar way as to the previous result.

<Aside type='definition' title='Definition' name='Limit and isolated points'>
	Given a topological space $ X $, and a set $ A \subseteq X $, we say that a point $ p \in X $ is a <em> limit point </em> of $ A $ if every neighbourhood of $ p $ contains a point of $ A $ other than $ p $.

	On the other hand, a point $ p \in A $ is called an <em> isolated point </em> of $ A $ if there exists a neighbourhood $ U $  of $ p $ such that $ U \cap A = \{ p \} $.
</Aside>

	<TabItem label='Problem'>
	Show that a subset is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points.
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label='Solution'>
		We can make a neat argument using the previous proposition. Since every neighbourhood of every limit point $ x $ of $ A $ contains a point of $ A $ other than the point $ x $ itself, the point $ x $ must be contained by the closure $ \overline{A} $. Furthermore since, $ A $ is closed if and only if $ A = \overline{A} $, every limit point is contained by $ A $ if and only if $ A = \overline{A} $ if and only if $ A $ is closed.

	Show that a subset $ A \subseteq X $ is dense in $ X $ if and only if every nonempty open subset of $ X $ contains a point in $ A $.

	<TabItem label='Solution'>
		$ \overline{A} = X $ if and only if every neighbourhood of every point in $ X $ has nonempty intersection with $ A $. In particular, the statement 'every neighbourhood of every point in $ X $' is exhaustive of nonempty open sets in the topology of $ X $, and hence the statement follows.

## Convergence and continuity
<Aside type='definition' title='Definition' name='Sequence convergence'>
	For a topological space $ X $ and a sequence $ ( x_{n} )_{n=1}^{\infty} $ of points in $ X $, we say that the <em> sequence converges </em> to $ x $ if for every neighbourhood $ U $ of $ x $, there exists some $ N \in \mathbb{N} $ such that $ x_{n} \in U $ for all $ n \geq N $.
</Aside>

	<TabItem label='Problem'>
	Show that in a metric space, the topological definition of convergence is equivalent to the metric space definition.

	<TabItem label='Solution'>
		To solve this exercise, we want to show that a sequence converges in a metric space if and only if the sequence converges in the respective topological space with the induced metric topology. Consider the following equivalences, starting with the definition of convergence in a metric space.
$$
\begin{gather*}
			\forall \epsilon>0 \ \exists N \in \mathbb{N} \text{ s.t. } d ( x_{n}, x )< \epsilon \ \forall n \geq N\\
			\iff \\
			\forall \epsilon>0 \ \exists N \in \mathbb{N} \text{ s.t. } x_{n} \in B^{(d)}( x;\epsilon ) \ \forall n \geq N\\
			\iff \\
			\text{ for every neighbourhood } U \text{ of } x \ \exists N \in \mathbb{N} \text{ s.t. } x_{n}\in U \ \forall n \geq N

		Suppose for the sake of contradiction that this wasn't the case, and the limit $ x $ of a convergent sequence $ ( x_{i} ) $ was such that $ x \in \exterior{A} $.

<summary>Proof</summary>
		We deal with each of the statements in turn.
		
			- Suppose that $ f:X \to Y: x \mapsto a \in Y $. Then, an open set $ U \subseteq Y $ is either $ U \supseteq \{ a \} $ or $ U \not \supseteq \{ a \} $. In the first case, $ f ^{-1}( U ) = X $ which is open, and in the second case $ f ^{-1}( U ) = \varnothing $, which is also open.

<Aside type='result' title='Proposition' name='Local criterion for continuity'>
	A map $ f:X \to Y $ is continuous if and only if each point of $ X $ has a neighbourhood on which the restriction of $ f $ is continuous.
	<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
		If the function $ f $ is continuous, then we can simply take $ X $ to be the open neighbourhood of every point.

		On the contrary, let $ U \subseteq Y $, where we aim to show that $ f ^{-1}( U ) $ is open in $ X $. Taking some $ x \in f ^{-1}( U ) $, we know that there exists neighbourhood $ V_{x} $ of $ x $ such that $ f |_{V_{x}} $ is continuous. In particular, $ f|_{V_{x}}^{-1}( U ) $ is open. Also,
$$
\begin{align*}
			f|_{V_{x}}^{-1}( U ) = \{ x \in V_{x}: f ( x ) \in U \} = V_{x} \cap f ^{-1}( U )
\end{align*}
$$
		and in particular, $ f|_{V_{x}}^{-1}( U )\subseteq f ^{-1}( U ) $, is an open neighbourhood of $ x $. The arbitrary choice of $ x \in f ^{-1}( U ) $ then determines that $ f ^{-1}( U ) $ is open.

<Aside type='definition' title='Definition' name='Homeomorphism'>
	A <em> homeomorphism </em> from $ X $ to $ Y $ is a bijective map $ \phi:X \to Y $ such that $ \phi $ and $ \phi ^{-1} $ are continuous.

	If there exists a homeomorphism between $ X $ and $ Y $, we say that $ X $ and $ Y $ are <em> topologically equivalent </em>, or <em> homeomorphic </em>. We denote this relation by $ X \homeomorphic Y $.

		We aim to show that homeomorphisms are reflexive, transitive and symmetric.
		
			- Reflexive: taking $ \identity_{X}:X \to X $, we see that this map is bijective, continuous, and has continuous inverse. Hence $ X \homeomorphic X $.
			- Transitive: consider the homeomorphisms $ f:X \to Y $ and $ g:Y \to Z $. Then, $ g \circ f:X \to Z $ is continuous, bijective from $ X $ to $ Z $, and has continuous inverse $ f ^{-1}\circ g ^{-1}: Z \to X $. Hence $ X \homeomorphic Z $.

$$
\begin{align*}
				      \overline{f ( A )} = \bigcap_{B \supseteq f ( A )}{\{ B: X \setminus B \in \tau_{X} \}}.
\end{align*}
$$
			      We know that $ f ( \overline{A} ) $ is a closed set containing $ f ( A ) $, and the result follows.

<Aside type='definition' title='Definition' name='Local homeomorphism'>
	A map $ f:X \to Y $ is called a <em> local homeomorphism </em> if every point $ x \in X $ has a neighbourhood $ U \subseteq X $ such that $ f ( U ) $ is an open subset of $ Y $ and $ f|_{U}:U \to f ( U ) $ is a homeomorphism.
</Aside>

<Aside type='result' title='Proposition' name='Properties of local homeomorphisms'>
	We have the following properties,
	
		- Every homeomorphism is a local homeomorphism.
		- Every local homeomorphism is continuous and open.
		- Every bijective local homeomorphism is a homeomorphism.
	
	<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
		We work through the statements in turn.
		
			- This is clear. Since $ X $ is open, and $ f ( X ) = Y $, $ f $ is a valid local homeomorphism for all points $ x \in X $.
			- We know from the local criterion for continuity that a function $ f $ is continuous if and only if each point $ x \in X $ has a neighbourhood $ U $ such that $ f|_{U} $ is continuous. If we consider a local homeomorphism $ f $, we know that this function is a homeomorphism on open neighbourhoods of every points $ x \in X $, and therefore is continuous. We also know that every restriction of $ f $ is open, and therefore $ f $ is open also.
			- Using a previous result, we know that a continuous, open bijection is a homeomorphism.

<Aside type='result' title='Proposition' name=''>
